# Predicting Customer Churn & Lifetime Value through Enhanced Retail Segmentation

**Overview:**

This project focuses on developing a robust customer segmentation model for a retail business to predict customer churn and lifetime value (CLTV).  The analysis leverages machine learning techniques to identify high-value, at-risk customer segments. This allows for the implementation of targeted retention strategies and optimized resource allocation, ultimately improving customer loyalty and profitability.  The project performs exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to achieve these goals.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings and insights from the analysis to the console, including details on the identified customer segments, their churn probabilities, and average CLTV.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segmentation.png`, `churn_probability_distribution.png`) which provide visual representations of the key results and insights derived from the analysis. These plots will be saved in the `output` directory.  The specific outputs and visualizations will depend on the data used.


**Data:**

This project requires a dataset containing customer transactional and demographic information.  An example dataset (if available) would be included in a separate directory. Please ensure that any sensitive data is anonymized before use.
